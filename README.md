# News_Summarizer
A deep learning-based news summarization project using the facebook/bart-large-xsum transformer model, fine-tuned on the Kaggle dataset CNN-DailyMail News Text Summarization. This system generates concise and coherent summaries of lengthy news articles, making information easier to consume.

##  Features

- **Automated Summarization**: Generates meaningful summary for any given news article.
- **State-of-the-Art NLP Model**: Built using the **BART transformer model**, specifically fine-tuned for summarization tasks.
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Accepts raw text input or loads articles from a dataset.

##  Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For leveraging `facebook/bart-large-xsum`.
- **Kaggle Datasets**: For accessing and managing the CNN-DailyMail dataset.

##   How It Works

1. **Data Input**: Input is provided in the form of plain text or from the CNN-DailyMail dataset.
2. **Preprocessing**: The text is tokenized using BART's tokenizer and formatted for model input.
3. **Summarization**: The fine-tuned `facebook/bart-large-xsum` model generates a summary of the input article.
4. **Postprocessing**: Output is decoded and formatted for display.
